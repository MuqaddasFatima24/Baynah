# 🕊️ Baynah – Shop with Integrity

**Baynah (بَيِّنَة)** means *clarity*, *evidence*, or *truth* in Arabic.  
This platform empowers you to make clear, conscious choices in a world clouded by misinformation and injustice.


## ✨ Why We Created Baynah

> "*The greatest threat to justice is not cruelty, but indifference.*"

In the midst of genocide, war crimes, and global inaction—**your purchases have power**.  
**Baynah** was born from the urgent need to resist injustice through everyday actions like shopping and donating.

- **We believe** every item you avoid from unethical corporations is a form of protest.
- **We believe** that donating to verified NGOs is a lifeline for the oppressed.
- **We believe** you shouldn't need to sift through hours of research to shop ethically.
